# Commodities Trading Strategies

Commodities, such as oil, gold, and agricultural products, are influenced by supply and demand factors, seasonality, and geopolitical events. Trading commodities offers diversification but requires an understanding of specific market forces.

## Popular Commodities Strategies

### Seasonal Trends
Many commodities exhibit seasonal price patterns. For instance, natural gas prices tend to rise in the winter due to heating demand, while crop prices may fluctuate with the planting and harvest seasons.

### Spread Trading
Spread trading involves buying and selling two related commodities simultaneously, capitalizing on price differences. For example, a trader might go long on crude oil and short on natural gas if the historical price relationship suggests one is undervalued.

### Futures Roll Strategy
Many commodity traders employ a roll strategy, shifting positions from a near-term contract to a longer-term one to maintain exposure without taking physical delivery. This approach benefits from contango or backwardation in futures markets.

## Risk Management
Commodities are often volatile and influenced by external factors, such as weather, global trade, and geopolitical events. Traders should use stop-loss orders, position limits, and carefully monitor news affecting commodity supply and demand.
