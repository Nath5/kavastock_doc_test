# Advanced Risk Management Techniques

Risk management is essential to avoid catastrophic losses and ensure long-term success. Effective risk management involves controlling exposure, setting clear exit points, and creating a diversified approach to safeguard capital.

## Core Techniques

● **Position Sizing:** Limiting exposure on each trade to a fixed percentage of the portfolio helps traders avoid overexposure to any single trade. Adjusting position size based on volatility enables more controlled risk-taking while optimizing potential returns.

● **Stop-Losses and Trade Management:** Placing stop-loss orders at strategic levels, like support or resistance, helps control losses while allowing for profit potential. Trailing stops enable traders to lock in gains by adjusting stop-loss levels as prices move in their favor.
